# Yolov8-and-Mediapipe-for-Fall-Detection
Developed an advanced algorithmic model that leverages the capabilities of YOLOv8 and MediaPipe. This model is designed to detect multi-person fall incidents in real-time through camera feeds. The primary objective of this model is to enhance safety measures by providing immediate alerts in the event of fall accidents, thereby facilitating prompt response and intervention. This innovative approach combines the power of object detection and pose estimation to deliver accurate and efficient fall detection in diverse scenarios.
